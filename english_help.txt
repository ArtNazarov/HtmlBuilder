The field label is included in the template using the {fX} code,
the value of the additional field using the {vX} code, where
X - field number from 1 to 7. Edit field labels
available on the General Settings tab.



- Module support

A module is a console program that extends the capabilities of a generator.
Modules can be written in any programming language,
allowing you to save plain text files to disk.
The only requirement is a module named modulename
must create a modulename.tmp file.
This file takes the generator and deletes the temporary file.

For example, the youtube module inserts HTML markup for
player by video ID. To call a module, you need
frame its name and call parameters with a % sign:

%youtubeID%

Modules can also be used to process HTML snippets,
To do this, the text must be framed with special tags.

~module~
HTML snippet
~/module~

The fragment is passed by the generator to a temporary module.inp file,
the module must provide the output file module.out to the generator.
The input and output file will be removed automatically by the generator.
For example, to automatically convert markdown to HTML,
just call the code

~markdown~
markup
~/markdown~

The path to the module must be specified in the PATH variable, or the module
should be set to directory with HtmlBuilder


- Archiver

The program uses the 7z utility of the 7-Zip archiver.
The 7z utility must be installed in the C:\Program Files\7-Zip directory
You can get the archiver at http://www.7-zip.org/
